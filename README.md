# Code-BEP-Hybrid-Approach-Model-Based-And-RL-Interception-Logic

In the main map, the Matlab code of the simulator is within SPG_matlab_code-main. Furthermore, all codes from python to train the RL agent are in Python Codes, where AgentTestingFile can be used to visualize how the agent works and RLTrainingLoop is the code where the agent can be trained. If you do not want visualizations, the code concerning the figure needs to be commented out in SPGsimulator and in update_seperate_file. 
To use the Python-Matlab code, at the top of the codes in Python that use the connection an explanation is given.
